A synthesis of my master's thesis with up to ten pages.

Abstract


Introduction (7 pages)
\section{From Paper to Bits}
\section{Scripting}
\section{Generative Design}
\section{IDEs for Generative Design}
\section{Disadvantages of Current CAD Applications}
\section{Goals} (more explicit + forward references)
(the problem + my contributions) (briefly refer to related work when needed)


The problem, the idea and the solution (14 pages)
(put more detail about the problem)
\section{Overview}
