Evaluation here...

In order to check that our work is indeed capable of producing 3D models relevant to architects' needs, we have made several programs using it.
In the following sections we will describe some of them.

\section{Truss example}


%Describe possible programming techniques using the IDE / our solution.
%- Examples of use (made by me)
%- Example from architect (e.g. InÃªs Caetano)
%- Performance: web page vs remote CAD service vs rosetta
