%There is still a lot of work to be done in online programming environments for architecture, in fact too much work to be done in a master thesis, at least that's what my advisor says.


%Achievements


%%Future work
%- LightTable code document, code navigation (large enough projects)
%- Security: Sanitize code


%- Support common programming languages like Python and Processing
%- Running on WebWorker or on server
%- Static analysis + code completion
%- Timetable view + user control of what is on the table
%- Some sort of error reporting
%- Persistence: multi-user, projects/packages, versions, sharing, dependencies
%- Manipulation with handles in the 3D (e.g. Antimony, Bret Victor)
%- Real-time collaboration
%- More primitives
%- Better camera controls
%- WebSockets for remote CAD service communication
%- Send entire results to remote CAD service instead of individually
