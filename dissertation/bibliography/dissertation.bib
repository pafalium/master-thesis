@book{reas2007processing,
abstract = {It has been more than twenty years since desktop publishing reinvented design, and it's clear that there is a growing need for designers and artists to learn programming skills to fill the widening gap between their ideas and the capability of their purchased software. This book is an introduction to the concepts of computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity.Processing have been tested in classrooms, workshops, and arts institutions, including UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, New York University, and Harvard University. Tutorial units make up the bulk of the book and introduce the syntax and concepts of software (including variables, functions, and object-oriented programming), cover such topics as photography and drawing in relation to software, and feature many short, prototypical example programs with related images and explanations. More advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and typography are discussed in interviews with their creators. "Extensions" present concise introductions to further areas of investigation, including computer vision, sound, and electronics. Appendixes, references to other material, and a glossary contain additional technical details. Processing can be used by reading each unit in order, or by following each category from the beginning of the book to the end. The Processing software and all of the code presented can be downloaded and run for future exploration.With essays by:<br Alexander R. Galloway, Golan Levin, R. Luke DuBois, Simon Greenwold, Francis Li, and Hernando Barrag\'{a}n and interviews with Jared Tarbell, Martin Wattenberg, James Paterson, Erik van Blockland, Ed Burton, Josh On, J\"{u}rg Lehni, Auriea Harvey and Micha\"{e}l Samyn, Mathew Cullen and Grady Hall, Bob Sabiston, Jennifer Steinkamp, Ruth Jarman and Joseph Gerhardt, Sue Costabile, Chris Csikszentmih\'{a}lyi, Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman, and Mark Hansen.},

@article{lopes2011portable,
abstract = {Most CAD applications provide programming languages for automation and generative design. However, programs written in these languages are not portable because they execute only in the family of CAD applications for which they were originally written. Consequently, users are locked-in to one family of CAD applications and they cannot reuse programs written for other families. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem: Rosetta, a programming environment that is compatible with several CAD applications. Rosetta is composed of (1) an abstraction layer that allows portable and transparent access to several different CAD applications; (2) back-ends that translate the abstraction layer into different CAD applications; ( 3 ) front-end programming languages in which users write the generative design programs; and ( 4 ) an intermediate programming language that encompasses the language constructs essential for geometric modeling and that is used as a compilation target for the front-ends. Rosetta allows users to explore different front-ends and back-ends, in order tofind a combination that is most suitable for the problem at hand. As a result, users have access to different programming languages, namely, visual and textual, which can be used interchangeably to write generative design programs, without breaking portability. Furthermore, Rosetta ensures that a single program can be used to create identical geometric models in different CAD applications. This approach promotes the developmentof programs that are portable across the most used CAD applications, thus facilitating the dissemination of the programs and of the underlying ideas.},

Their support for a rich variety of programming mechanisms means that the complexity of the program can remain commensurate with the com- plexity of the modelling task. A prototype parametric modelling sys- tem called Mo?bius is presented that aims to overcome the limitations of existing VPL systems. The proposed system integrates associative and imperative programming styles and supports iterative looping and higher order functions. In order to demonstrate the versatility of the Mo?bius, a modelling task is presented that requires the model to be modified.},

@book{Maeda:2001:DN:559503,
abstract = {Most art and technology projects pair artists with engineers or scientists: the artist has the conception, and the technical person provides the know-how. John Maeda is an artist and a computer scientist, and he views the computer not as a substitute for brush and paint but as an artistic medium in its own right. Design By Numbers is a reader-friendly tutorial on both the philosophy and nuts-and-bolts techniques of programming for artists.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPracticing what he preaches, Maeda composed Design By Numbers using a computational process he developed specifically for the book. He introduces a programming language and development environment, available on the Web, which can be freely downloaded or run directly within any JAVA-enabled Web browser. Appropriately, the new language is called DBN (for "design by numbers"). Designed for "visual" people—artists, designers, anyone who likes to pick up a pencil and doodle—DBN has very few commands and consists of elements resembling those of many other languages, such as LISP, LOGO, C/JAVA, and BASIC.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThroughout the book Maeda emphasizes the importance—and delights—of understanding the motivation behind computer programming, as well as the many wonders that emerge from well-written programs. Sympathetic to the "mathematically challenged," he places minimal emphasis on mathematics in the first half of the book. Because computation is inherently mathematical, the books second half uses intermediate mathematical concepts that generally do not go beyond high-school algebra. The reader who masters the skills so clearly set out by Maeda will be ready to exploit the true character of digital media design.},

@book{terzidis2003expressive,
abstract = {The mode of utilizing computers in architecture today is vague, inexplicit, and, often, arbitrary. Designers tend to conceptualize entities or processes and then enter, manipulate and print using computer systems. Often, theories of design and form are "translated" into computational ones, merely to participate in the digital fashion. This situation creates confusion, misunderstanding, and inconsistency for both students and practitioners over the appropriate use of computers in architecture and design. Challenging these assumptions, this book offers an appropriate theoretical context for computer-based experimentations, explorations, and form-making. By employing computational and formal theories, the author offers a theoretical bridge between the establishment of the past and the potential of the future.},
